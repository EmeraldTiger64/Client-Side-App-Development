				<h2>Diamond Vehicle Corporation (DVC) Website:</h2>
				<section class="projects">
					<img src="dvcHomePage.png" />
					<p>During my second year at William Penn University, I had to create a very basic website for one of my classes. I decided upon creating a website for a fictional
						automotive company called Diamond Vehicle Corporation. This was a basic introduction to the HTML and CSS languages and is something that I am genuinely proud
						of having done. While the website looks like a website from the late 90s, it was a good introduction to web design and programming. As for DVC, it exists in a
						story project that I had been working on with friends at the time, that is currently a dead project, but the website's files that I still have are a great
						reminder of the project. My professor in that class was genuinely impressed with the project and how generally clean the website was, despite it's primative looks.
						As for the information that is contained on the site, it is some basic lore that I could remember at the time about the company as it relates to the project. The only
						page with content is the main page that is pictured, but the nav par at the top does work with a very basic page behind each that states that those pages are empty right now.

				<h2>Lathed Center Punch:</h2>
				<section class="projects">
					<img src="centerPunch.png" />
					<p>During my first year at William Penn University I was going for a mechanical engineering degree, and as a part of that degree I needed to take a
						metalworking class. Throughout this class we had a variety of metal-working labs that we had to do each week, and one of my prouder projects from that time in the
						metals shop was a center punch that I had to turn out on one of the lathes, before moving onto sanding, buffing, and polishing it. Throughout that process, we also
						had to heat-treat the punch, then buff and polish it again, before finally tempering the punch end of the part and buffing and polishing again. The whole thing was
						a process, but I learned a ton throughout the process and would absolutely love to do it again someday. However, I ended up switching my degree from mechanical enginnering
						to software engineering my second year at William Penn.

				<h2>Trip Cost Estimator Website:</h2>
				<section class="projects">
					<img src="" />
					<p>During my second year at William Penn while finishing up my web programming class, we had to design a very basic website that utilized some form of JavaScript on 
						the server-side. This was my first experience with creating basic forms and messing with JavaScript as well as my first experience delving into the different nuances of server-side 
						vs client-side web development. For this final project of the semester, I decided to create a web-based automotive trip estimator. To use this website, you would input the miles you
						plan to travel, the fuel mileage of your car, average fuel prices, the average cost of an oil change, and the average tire price. Using the JavaScript, the website will do the math using
						the most typical intervals for oil and tire changes, and will estimate the overall cost of a trip in terms of the amount of fuel used as well as the wear on the tires and oil based on the
						miles that the user plans to travel. While not overly-complex and certainly not considering every wear cost on a vehicle, the website is simple and was a great way to fully serve as a gauge
						for how well I was grasping basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

					<h3>Aurora:</h3>
					<img src="Aurora_RainyDay.png">
					<p>One of my favorite projects, my 1988 Ford F-150. When I bought this truck, it had quite a lot wrong with it, and over time I have been repairing it.</p>
					<p>In my time of owning the truck, I have discovered that working on older vehicles is no cake walk. It can be difficult to find parts available or even to find documentation such as wiring diagrams. However, the feeling of fixing something successfully and ensuring that a vehicle so old can still be used today is quite a nice one. I plan to soon begin a full restoration on the truck, including rebuilding the engine, doing body work, and rewiring the whole vehicle.</p>
					<p><strong>During the process of restoration, I will be doing several things to the truck, including:</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Cleaning and painting the frame.</li>
						<li>Rebuilding the engine.</li>
						<li>Repairing body damage.</li>
						<li>Rewiring the entire vehicle, top-to-bottom.</li>
						<li>Rediong the interior.</li>
						<li>Installing new equipment throughout the vehicle.</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Much of the work I will be performing will be to make the truck safe, comfortable, and drivable in most any conditions. And the goal with the bodywork is to make the truck look brand new again. Itâ€™ll be a lot of work, but I greatly look forward to getting my hands dirty with it.</p>

					<h3>PipBoy 6400 Mk.I</h3>
					<p>I had another project that I was working on previously, and want to continue working on when I have the time to do so. The PipBoy. Fans of the popular video game franchise "Fallout" will know that this trustly little device is any wastelander's best friend.</p>
					<p>The goal here was to make a fully functioning PipBoy to be worn as a costume prop. I was designing a shell and enclosure for the device in Solidworks, of which the Raspberry Pi 3 computer, along with all of the other electronics, would be housed. When walking around with the PipBoy, the screen would be able to be toggled between the major different sections of information that you can see in the game. This project is currently stalled-out, but I do plan to return to it soon.</p>
