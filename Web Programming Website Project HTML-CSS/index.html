			<p><em>"Throughout the years, automotive manufacturers have taken a step to refine the shape of their automobiles while also making them more high-tech and efficient. But what about those of us who love the styling and shapes of classic cars and trucks, but still would love to have all of the efficiency, safety, and tecnological benefits of modern production vehicles? We are Diamond Vehicle Corporation, and our goal is to bring back classic automobile styling, but mix modern technology and design into our vehicles."</em></p>

			<h1>Our Vision</h1>
			<p>What we at Diamond Vehicle Corporation, or DVC for short, strive to do is to bring back the classic styling of older vehicles, while also making them much safer, more efficient, and more comfortable to drive. We also want to provide a quality vehicle that is unrivaled in its quality, and could even be a vehicle that you could drive for a lifetime, so long as it is cared for.
			<h1>A Brief History</h1>
			<p>Diamond Vehicle Corporation was founded by Rico Levi Oliver, his wife, Connie Sue Oliver, and Rico's three childhood best friends, Alexi MacDougall, Patrick Shyhawk, and Sidney Rhinehart, in late-2000. Rico, who graduated with a mechanical engineering degree, had been hard at work in the prior years to design and develop his own take on a truck, and this truck became the first vehicle that DVC would produce, the 2001 DVC D-Series. The D-Series quickly became popular throughout the Diamond Republic for its ease of repair, reliability, and retro body design that took inspirations from late-70s Chevy full-sized trucks, as well as mid-to-late-80s Ford full-sized trucks.</p>
			<p>Throughout 2001, DVC saw the introduction of the full-sized Stanley sedan, and when the group realized what they had in the design of these two vehicles, they immediately looked for a place to setup a headquarters for the fledgling company. Before the deebut of the D-Series and Stanley, DVC chose their headquarters and began making preparations for protoype vehicles, before finally moving to full production. DVC's 1369 Enderpaw Drive headquarters has been their home from the very beginning, and now encompasses a complex of multiple buildings and factories. Over the years since it's founding, DVC has very rapidly grown into becomming an automotive giant, now the main supplier of various emergency and military vehicles for the Diamond Republic's military and emergency services.</p>
